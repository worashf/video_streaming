# Video Streaming Application with Node.js, Nest.js, React, and Vite

> This project showcases the development of a video streaming application using Node.js, Nest.js, React, and Vite. Node.js is chosen for its efficiency in handling asynchronous tasks and the ability to send content in chunks, making it an excellent choice for video streaming applications. The backend is built with Nest.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, JWT authentication, Passport-JWT, and Multer.

# Features
- Efficient content transmission in chunks with Node.js.
- Backend API built with Nest.js for a modular and structured server-side architecture.
